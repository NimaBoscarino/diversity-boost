# Diversity Filter, a Chrome extension

A Chrome extension that adds a "Diversity Boost!" plugin to my twitter home feed.

Makes a request to an API (hosted on Heroku) that fetches the 200 most recent tweets by the accounts I follow, and sorts them to give a boost to non-male users and PoC users (manually classified as a proof of concept).
